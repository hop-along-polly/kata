# Kata
There are a ton of online coding Dojos out there; CodeWars, HackerRank etc. and kata are common
place in technical interviews. Most often the kata presented in an interview are academic
in nature and rely on a specific algorithm or data structure that an inteviewee may not have
used outside of their academic career.

This repo contains what I consider to be fundamental kata. Through these kata you will learn
how to build data structures like linked lists, binary search trees, and graphs as well as
how to use them to solve common algorithm based questions all while enforcing good coding
discipline around coding style, Test Driven Development (TDD) and Object Oriented best
practices like SOLID Design Principles.

Each kata is accompanied by a README explaining the Data Structure/Algorithm and a full test
suite so you can follow TDD while solving it. Look to the specific README within the language
folder for specific environment or kata specific instructions.

## Structure
Data structures, algorithms, Test-Driven-development, SOLID design principles, and OO transcend any programming language. As a
self proclaimed polyglot I want to teach these concepts in various language. You will find a folder for each of the concepts
containing a README that explains the data structure, covers algorithmic complexity and explores some algorithms that use that
data structure. Every concept folder will have language specific subfolders (i.e. python, node, C#) etc. containing everything
you need to get started including a README, requirements files, and most importantly unit tests.

        2. Pim's algorithm


## Contributing
I would love additional language contributions. I plan on providing tests in Python, C#, javascript (node.js), but Golang and Rust would be awesome.
This project aims to be a framework for teaching new developers so documentation, READMEs and clean code are essential.
